This is my journey through the Elements of Computing Systems, second edition -
building a modern computer from first principles by Noam Nisan and Shimon
Schocken.

The `hdl` directory contains elementary logic gate implementations written
using the simplified HDL (Hardware Description Language). These are done as the
first project in the book and are the foundational components that are used to
build the more complicated chips.

It also contains some more advanced components, like half-adder, full adder,
16-bit adder and 16-bit increment, as well as a 16-bit ALU implementations.
These are developed as part of the second project.
