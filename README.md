This is my journey through the Elements of Computing Systems, second edition -
building a modern computer from first principles by Noam Nisan and Shimon

The `hdl` directory contains elementary logic gate implementations written
using the simplified HDL (Hardware Description Language). These are done as the
first project in the book and are the foundational components that are used to
build the more complicated chips.
